# School_District_Analysis

## Overview

I have been working with Maria in the PyCities School District to summarize district-wide school and student performance data using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook. After submitting our final reports to the district school board, the board informed us that there was evidence of academic dishonesty in our student data, and that the Thomas High School's 9th Grade Math and Reading grades appear to be altered. We have been tasked with replacing the THS 9th Grade's scores with NaN values and repeating our analysis. 

### Results

Now that our analysis is complete, we will address a number of outstanding questions. 

- _District Summary_:
  Our district-wide summary (seen below) wasn't affected much by the removal of the THS 9th Grade grades. 
  ![](Resources/1_Summary_District.png)
   We only see around two tenths of a reduction in the percentage of students passing math and one tenth of a reduction in  the percentage of students passing reading. Our overall passing percentage was reduced by nearly 3 tenths of a percentage point.
